You are my navigator. I write the code.

Goal:
Create a ShelfCarousel component that renders posters as "boxes on a shelf".

Constraints:
- Use shadcn/ui Carousel (Embla-based). [page:0]
- Provide responsive item sizing using basis utilities
- Provide loading skeleton + error fallback

Deliver:
- File paths, small steps, and prop interface.
- Do not write full code unless I ask after attempting.
