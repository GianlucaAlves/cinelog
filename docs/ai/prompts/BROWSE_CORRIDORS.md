# Copilot Prompt — Browse Corridors (Scroll Snap)

You are my navigator. I write the code.

Goal:
Implement /browse corridors navigation.

Constraints:
- React + TS + Tailwind + shadcn
- Use Tailwind scroll snap utilities: snap-x + snap-mandatory on container and snap alignment on children. [page:1]
- Must work with trackpad, mousewheel, and touch
- Add minimap dots indicating current corridor
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Deliver:
1) Ask me which corridors we want (names + count) and which data source (mock vs TMDB).
2) Propose file structure (components + hooks).
3) Provide step-by-step implementation plan.
4) Provide acceptance checklist.
