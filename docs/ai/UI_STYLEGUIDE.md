# UI Styleguide — Locadora (Modern)

## Principles
- Neon is environmental (signage/reflections), UI stays readable.
- UI is modern: consistent spacing, clean typography, clear CTAs.
- Nostalgia via metaphors: door, aisles, shelves, receipts, membership card.

## Motion
- Default: subtle ambient motion (slow background), short UI transitions.
- Reduced motion: disable parallax/ambient; keep only opacity changes.

## Components
- EntranceCard: headline + primary CTA + optional search.
- SessionWidget: 3 times + “See more”.
- MembershipCardCTA: secondary action, card-like visuals.
- CorridorSection: snap section with a shelf carousel.
